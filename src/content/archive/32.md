[üéµ _Chain reaction, shades of passion, we surrender, lose control..._ üéµ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw4AV_BeE24&list=PLYRq_7Yox1jDETeL_YgKUc8DXduCV9jA2&index=33)

A lot of water has flowed under the bridge during this fortnight of metaframeworks world (_and my vacation time)_. Not everything was roses, so even the shiniest updates to tools and technologies we love should be taken with a grain of salt, but nevertheless, tech is moving forward and we have a lot of new cool stuff to add to our full-stack projects. Let's dive deeper into which of them will be useful for each of us specifically.

## The Good

Release of a new version of [React](https://metaframe.works/tags/react/), which is the basis for many metaframeworks and (_at least tangentially_) the inspiration for the others, is always a notable event in the full-stack webdev world. Even a minor one, and even without drastic changes, it allows us to see the future direction and adjust to the latest developments. [This time around](https://react.dev/blog/2025/10/01/react-19-2), in version 19.2, it's largely about performance improvements for the framework (_including React DOM_) and its consumers, which makes total sense in light of constant attacks to React from more performance-oriented alternatives. It's especially interesting how SSR gets more attention on the wave of coming back with classical web development roots and approaches.

More big news related to React and all the ecosystem [came just yesterday](https://react.dev/blog/2025/10/07/introducing-the-react-foundation): the framework is going to get a new governance model which will decouple it more from Meta ‚Äî the React Foundation. The development will still be governed largely by big corporations, but at least it won't be a monopoly, which is good. Even though many React fans are not happy to see some of the listed companies ‚Äî specifically Vercel, which has gotten some bad reputation lately over [the company's CEO unpleasant acquaintances](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1972669025525158031) (_to the extent everything around Vercel became doomed [for some of us](https://bsky.app/profile/bnb.im/post/3lzyqkoemik2s) and triggered [some funny speculations](https://bsky.app/profile/deno.land/post/3m22eylstfs2a) from competing deployment platforms_). But open governance is a big thing for an open-source project, and I personally am excited to see where it leads React and everything around that.

For instance, [RSCs](https://metaframe.works/tags/rsc/) became a de-facto standard in the ecosystem and the React Router team [proceed with integrating that](https://remix.run/blog/rsc-framework-mode-preview) tightly and deeper into the metaframework based on the library. Other vendors move fast with that too, and you can check their stance in this regard using [this awesome project](https://rsc.krasimirtsonev.com) I had found recently.

On a side note, another project with the great governance model, ESLint, [announced some details](https://eslint.org/blog/2025/10/whats-coming-in-eslint-10.0.0/) on its upcoming release 10.0.0 (_JSX will get some attention too, by the way_), including some of the breaking changes for the tool, which is so ubiquitous the alternative providers try to model their solutions over ESLint's developments. I really admire the structural and methodical approach of Nicholas Zakas and the team, there is indeed much to learn from their approach.

## The Bad

Following multiple recent supply chain vulnerabilities (_see [this recent issue](https://metaframe.works/archive/31/#:~:text=There%20were%20several%20attacks%20on%20the%20npm%20ecosystem%20during%20the%20last%20couple%20of%20weeks), and [this one](https://metaframe.works/archive/29/#:~:text=Nx%2C%20used%20widely%20for%20full%2Dstack%20and%20cross%2Dplatform%20projects%20based%20on%20variety%20of%20technologies%20including%20metaframeworks%2C%20got%20hacked) too, for specific illustrations_), GitHub [introduced some new measures](https://github.blog/security/supply-chain-security/our-plan-for-a-more-secure-npm-supply-chain/) to prevent some of the most obvious sources of the vulnerabilities and their consequences. Again, there are some obvious (_but not unreasonable, for what it's worth_) [speculations from competing vendors](https://deno.com/blog/deno-protects-npm-exploits), but all in all, the direction is good, and the earthquakes help to strengthen the Node ecosystem after all, which is especially important in the AI-empowered age of creativity, both positive and negative, unfortunately.

For some folks, these security incidents were another incentive [to move towards fewer dependencies](https://olliewilliams.xyz/blog/html-renaissance/) and more vanilla HTML+CSS+JS future. HTML indeed provides huge creative opportunities these days, browser vendors actively collaborate over new native features and APIs, and CSS is arguably one of the most quickly developing technology for the web in 2025. One of its gurus share [the refreshed CSS ~~reset~~ starter](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/the-coyier-css-starter/), for instance, which eliminates many obsolete presumptions and provides a modern approach to starting website/webapp development from scratch. And many developers proceed searching for complexity/simplicity equilibrium [through compromises like htmx](https://ajmoon.com/posts/mesh-i-tried-htmx-then-ditched-it).

## The Noteworthy

With all the back-to-school and [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) activity happening, the JavaScript/TypeScript metaframeworks developers are not sleeping too, bringing a lot of awesome updates and news.

The TanStack Start team is [actively preparing for the first stable release](https://tanstack.com/blog/announcing-tanstack-start-v1).

> TanStack Start isn‚Äôt just another framework, it‚Äôs the next chapter in building type-safe, high-performance React apps without the heavy abstractions.

Some developers have already [given it a good production try](https://catalins.tech/migrating-to-tanstack-start/). Who knows, maybe that's an ideal moment for TanStack Start indeed, taking all the backlash related to Vercel's ecosystem into account.

But even with this backlash in mind, ecosystems like Nuxt's are huge and they continue powering up a lot of awesome projects and delivering new value to them. For instance [Nuxt UI v4 brought some significant structural changes](https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-ui-v4) to the ecosystem.

> With this release, we are unifying Nuxt UI and Nuxt UI Pro into a single, powerful, and completely free open-source library.

Docusaurus, a popular (_and even somewhat pioneering_) React-based solution for documentation servers, [brings a series of AI-powered improvements](https://docusaurus.io/blog/releases/3.9) with their version 3.9.

The Astro team also [released a new minor version 5.14](https://astro.build/blog/astro-5140/) with a bunch of DX improvements and new integrations. They did a lot more, actually ‚Äî the things they discuss in a pretty engaging way in their regular [monthly retrospective](https://astro.build/blog/whats-new-september-2025/) and [the newsletter](https://buttondown.com/withastro/archive/the-astro-post-september-2025/), with lots of content gems from the ecosystem included.

The Void Zero gang published [their monthly retro too](https://voidzero.dev/posts/whats-new-sep-2025) including news from Vite, Vitest, Rolldown, and Oxc development (_TL;DR: of course, everything became a lot faster_). The same goes for the SvelteKit team, which, being part of the Svelte community, shared some awesomeness in [the regular digest](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-new-in-svelte-october-2025).

All in all, we see a lot of trend intersections and overlaps through these updates, and even human factor impacts on everything we use and love. That's inevitable for such a warm-hearted ecosystem as the world of JavaScript metaframeworks and tools around them. I hope after the fantastic series of the October events across the world, the positivity and friendliness will come back to this stream of events and reactions to them.

_And on a side note, I am very positive too, because today is the birthday of one of the first subscribers of this newsletter and constant inspiration for it, my sweetheart metaframeworks fan [Maria](https://uxapologist.com), and I dedicate this issue wholeheartedly to you, baby_ ‚ù§Ô∏è
