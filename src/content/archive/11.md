ðŸŽ¶ _All around the world, we could make time rompin' and a-stompin'..._ ðŸŽ¶

Today weâ€™ll visit USA and China, UK and Algeria, Portugal and Japan. As a bonus, we will find a life hack against developer migraines in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula.

## The Good

We usually don't talk about [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) here (_as [Vite](https://vite.dev) had won, of course_) but here we go: [version 2.14.0 brought support for React Server Components (RSC)](https://parceljs.org/blog/v2-14-0) which is huge because you don't need Next.js for that anymore (_other reasons to ditch Next.js down below too, don't miss out_). Moreover, you can adopt RSC in your SPAs progressively which is a very nice perk, along with the possibility of server rendering or static prerendering. There's a whole bunch of other updates in this release (_on this background even the regular updates of [the new version of Astro](https://astro.build/blog/astro-550/) fade a bit_) so if you're considering alternatives to bigger players, it's the sign. Looks like Parcel becomes another full-featured metaframework-like tool for React after all.

TanStack has been gaining more momentum lately with it's fine-grained approach to developer tooling around web applications. In the recent post ["Next.js vs TanStack"](https://www.kylegill.com/essays/next-vs-tanstack/) Kyle Gill proves (_another time_) that sometimes complexity of Next.js is a total overkill. As Jack Herrington, one of the TanStack maintainers, compared on [the recent episode of the ConTejas Code Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/nz/podcast/jack-herrington-model-context-protocol-mcp-growing/id1731855333?i=1000698551942), using tools like Next.js is similar to going to a guitar shop to get a guitar and being sold with a mixer, amplifyers, headphones, and a lot more in addition. So maybe TanStack is a better guitar indeed? One can only decide for themselves.

## The Bad

The previous metaframework week was marked by a huge scandal around [the middleware security vulnerability in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/blog/cve-2025-29927). It was a chain of informational events of different sorts where proponents and opponents of the metaframework rejoiced and grieved with varying success.

There haven't been many cases of this sort before (_it's [the critical-severity zero-day vulnerability](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw) affecting Next.js' versions starting from 11th, and potentially bringing down a huge part of the React-based web application market_). It became a reason for blaming Vercel and Next.js team by different [companies](https://www.netlify.com/blog/how-we-run-nextjs/) and [individuals](https://eduardoboucas.com/posts/2025-03-25-you-should-know-this-before-choosing-nextjs/), which is fair but still a bit one-sided, as Next.js is just a product built by people, as everything around is. The same week basically brought (_less critical but still_) vulnerability findings in [Nuxt](https://bsky.app/profile/danielroe.dev/post/3lkr3fpk3fk25) (_also a middleware issue BTW_) and [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-x574-m823-4x7w) (_the beautiful one, IMO_) too, for instance. Also there were some early findings allowing (_luckilly_) to [protect the vulnerable code by workarounds](https://projectdiscovery.io/blog/nextjs-middleware-authorization-bypass#workaround-for-unpatched-versions) until the dependencies are patched, which is very cool (_and that's what security tools should look into more and more, in a semi-automated way at least_).

What was interesting for me personally in this whole story is the persona of [the guy](https://x.com/zhero___) who spotted the vulnerability. His name is Rachid Allam, he's from Algeria (_[Eid Mubarak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_Mubarak) my friend!_), and he has [a lot of other findings](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/) (_including [very interesting Next.js stories](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-cache-and-chains-the-stale-elixir)_) behind his belt. The aforementioned Nuxt vulnerability is [his report too](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nuxt-show-me-your-payload), BTW (_how's that, huh?!_). I was really stocked to read his researches and specifically [this last notorious one](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-and-the-corrupt-middleware) which he made with his brother (_presumably â€” those hackers, you know!_) [Yasser](https://x.com/inzo____), causing [all this chaos](https://vercel.com/blog/postmortem-on-next-js-middleware-bypass) in the [mostly calm] metaframeworks security world.

This is probably an unpopular opinion, but we need more researchers and researches like that â€” in the end, it helps the industry to develop best practices and tools preventing drastic aftermath of adversarial acts. Metaframeworks have [a lot of very specific security problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/comments/1jf4yh8/how_to_secure_api_endpoints_from_direct_access/), and finding (_and tackling_) them helps to make this technical corner of the world better (_and don't forget to use [the proper way of bringing that to life](https://jacobian.org/2025/mar/27/reporting-security-issues-in-oss/), as, for instance, Jacob Kaplan-Moss, one of the Django inventors, suggests_).

## The Noteworthy

And traveling this very world on, we get to beautiful Barcelona where Aral Roca has [brought to life the new version of Brisa](https://brisa.build/blog/brisa-0.2.9) (_with improved security docs, BTW, which is trendy, as we saw_). And while the changes in such small tools are not huge too, as a rule (_but the same I could say about [the minor React Router updates](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v740), for instance â€” which is much bigger and ubiquitous tool, FWIW_) it's so cool to see it's development progressing and getting covered with new capabilities and features.

Talking about capabilities and features, yours truly has [virtually] travelled to China the last weekend to find out, [what UmiJS, the huge metaframework-like tooling ecosystem, actually is](https://dev.to/fyodorio/umijs-the-shaolin-of-web-frameworks-55d8) and how it works. Turns out there's more to the world than Vite, and Chinese enterprise developers have access to a decently innovative set of tools and technologies for building web applications and web sites.

I did that to get distracted from my migraine, actually. And as I mentioned at the very beginning, here's the long-awaited recipe against it (_to you, my patient long-reads fiend!_), if it's something that tortures you too [these AI-hype-overloaded days](https://bsky.app/profile/fyodor.io/post/3lkzv3palnc24) (_no, there's no anti-migraine MCP server, sorry!_). I (_being a British scientist of a sort_) made a small practical research which shown that for software developers [the flow state](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)#:~:text=Flow%20state%20theory%20suggests%20that,key%20determinant%20of%20learning%20success.>) is the best cure against headaches and migraines. And on contrary, multitasking and excessive social communication (_both offline and online_) are the worst pain-provokers. So I recommend you to add this newsletter issue to favourites (_or share it with a friend_), close the browser, take on your headphones with [a lo-fi jazz playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5R-aLmZ9Ps), open your AI-disabled IDE in a focus mode, and start chilling.

That's what we all are here for eventually.
