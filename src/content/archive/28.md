Some weeks bring really impressive amounts of updates in the metaframeworks world. Just recently I lamented that summer is too peaceful and calm, and now August is getting really hot, presumably preparing for September's back-to-school madness. Let's see what webdev fireworks the last week has brought to us.

## The Good

In the previous issue I [had mentioned the nice tradition](https://metaframe.works/archive/27/#:~:text=I%20love%20the%20practice%20of%20monthly%20news%20posts%20from%20the%20Astro%20team) of coming up with a monthly summary of ecosystem updates adopted by some open source maintainers. And I had totally missed [the awesome version of it](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-new-in-svelte-august-2025) from the Svelte team. [One of the updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/comments/1mnmad3/sveltekit_finally_has_server_functions/) specifically related to SvelteKit is [the remote functions feature](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions). There was [a lot of work](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/13897) dedicated to making that happen, and this possibility of separating application concerns even more in full-stack SvelteKit web apps gives a lot of room for imagination and technical creativity. One of the reasons for (_and enablements from_) remote functions was in-app communication safety and security, and Rich Harris had made [a thorough breakdown of some details of this aspect](https://bsky.app/profile/rich-harris.dev/post/3lw5zsctp7k2x) on Bluesky. All in all, it's one of the most interesting and exciting metaframework features lately, so worth attention and playing with (_and updating your SvelteKit apps where you feel it applicable_).

In a similar vein, Daishi Kato, the creator of Waku, announced the new feature of his metaframework ‚Äî [slices](https://newsletter.daishikato.com/p/waku-gets-slices-api-inspired-by-gatsby) (_and lazy slices_). The concept is largely inspired by [Gatsby's (_RIP!_) slices](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/performance/using-slices/) and provides developers with primitives similar to "islands" or "deferrable views" from other frameworks with some Waku-specific architectural details.

And last but not least in the list ‚Äî a sneak peek into Fresh 2, Deno's Preact-based metaframework's future release, in [the article by Kitson P. Kelly](https://kitsonkelly.com/posts/fresh-2-deploy-ea). And even though there aren't many new exciting features planned for that, it's still nice to see the work happening, as you can expect a good amount of innovation from the awesome Deno team.

> Fresh 2, at this stage, feels like more of a maintenance release where the underpinnings have been invested in, some of which mandate pretty material shifts to migrate from Fresh 1 to Fresh 2 without any major new features or capabilities.

## The Bad

Alex Petros of htmx (_providing pretty decent credibility for the topic I'm gonna announce_) gave a talk with a perturbing (_for us, frontend engineers_) title: ["What's Left for Frontend Engineers?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7M2inHiT4Y) (_with the accompanying [TL;DR post](https://unplannedobsolescence.com/talks/whats-left-for-frontend-engineers/) for those of us who are into ~~skimming~~ reading_). The web UI plumbing remnants that he predicts will keep us busy in the nearest years are a bit disappointing, but on the other hand, these observations confirm my (_obvious for this newsletter_) theory of metaframeworks getting a hold on the web dev of the 21st century (_everyone in media has the right for bold prophecies_). So if you're a zealous frontend developer, consider smoothing your "T"-shaped knowledge to "t" or some other (_more ramified_) character.

And while you do that, and get overwhelmed and panicked by [the amount of choice](https://metaframe.works/comparison/), remember that nobody, even the most clever guys, even the framework creators and maintainers, know everything and can have a clear idea of what to do and how to do it. For instance, the RedwoodSDK team, [having split up](<https://metaframe.works/archive/12/#:~:text=The%20RedwoodJS%20team%20had%20come%20with%20a%20huge%20(and%20unexpected)%20split>) with Redwood GraphQL several months ago, tries to promote [the repo](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk) at all costs (_congrats on the ‚≠ê1k milestone! üéâ_). And one funny way they do it is something new to me ‚Äî [posting ads](https://github.com/redwoodjs/graphql/releases/tag/announce-redwoodsdk) into/as the release/tag of another repo (_the very [Redwood GraphQL](https://github.com/redwoodjs/graphql)_). Is it weird? Definitely so. Is it worth it? Probably, but arguably. Anyway, now I know one more thing about open-source guerrilla marketing, thanks guys!

## The Noteworthy

The Astro team, prolific as usual, has released [the new minor 5.13](https://astro.build/blog/astro-5130/) (_they call it "Lucky" in the hope of getting away from the nemesis of doom_) with some nuggets like multiple sitemaps and enums in Astro DB tables. Honestly, why would anyone use anything else (_for static websites at least_) in 2025?!

BTW, for some shameful reasons Astro is missing from the list of participants in the new beginning from GitHub (_which is just an identity-less [part of some minor MS department](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/github-will-be-folded-into-microsoft-proper-as-ceo-steps-down/) now I guess, but still_) ‚Äî [GitHub Secure Open Source Fund](https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/securing-the-supply-chain-at-scale-starting-with-71-important-open-source-projects/). This fund includes all the cool guys from the metaframeworks scene now ‚Äî Next, Nuxt, and Svelte, and it sounds like a good addition to all the investment these projects get lately.

All in all, the amount of positivity and inventions of all sorts in the industry is increasing (_coinciding with the amount of OpenAI tokens consumed globally, but... nuh..._) and it gives hope for better outcomes for all of us, metaframeworks users. Or, in the worst case scenario, will present a couple of satisfied smirks to metaframeworks skeptics. We're gonna have fun inevitably anyway, so stay tuned!
