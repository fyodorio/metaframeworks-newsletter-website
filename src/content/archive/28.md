Some weeks bring really impressive amounts of updates in the metaframeworks world. Just recently I lamented that Summer is too peaceful and calm, and now the August is getting really hot, presumably preparing for the September's back-to-school madness. Let's see what webdev fireworks the last week had brought to us.

## The Good

In the previous issue I [had mentioned the nice tradition](https://metaframe.works/archive/27/#:~:text=I%20love%20the%20practice%20of%20monthly%20news%20posts%20from%20the%20Astro%20team) of coming up with a monthly summary of ecosystem updates adopted by some open source maintainers. And I had totally missed [the awesome version of it](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-new-in-svelte-august-2025) from Svelte guys. [One of the updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/comments/1mnmad3/sveltekit_finally_has_server_functions/) specifically related to SvelteKit is [the remote functions feature](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions). There was [a lot of work](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/13897) dedicated to making that happen and this possibility of separating application concerns even more in the full-stack SvelteKit web apps give a lot of room for imagination and technical creativity. One of the reasons for (_and enablements from_) remote functions was in-app communication safety and security and Rich Harris had made [the thorough breakdown on some details of this aspect](https://bsky.app/profile/rich-harris.dev/post/3lw5zsctp7k2x) on Bluesky. All in all, it's one of the most interesting and exciting metaframework features lately so worth attention and playing with (_and updating your SvelteKit apps where you feel it applicable_).

In the similar vein, Daishi Kato, the creator of Waku, announced the new feature of his metaframework ‚Äî [slices](https://newsletter.daishikato.com/p/waku-gets-slices-api-inspired-by-gatsby) (_and lazy slices_). The concept is largely inspired by [Gatsby's (_RIP!_) slices](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/performance/using-slices/) and provides developers with primitives similar to "islands" or "deferrable views" from other frameworks with some Waku's architectural specifics.

And last but not least in the list ‚Äî some sneak peek into Fresh 2, Deno's Preact-based metaframework future release, in [the article by Kitson P. Kelly](https://kitsonkelly.com/posts/fresh-2-deploy-ea). And even though there are not many new exciting features planned for that, it's still nice to see the work happening, as you can expect a good amount of innovation from the awesome Deno team.

> Fresh 2, at this stages, feels like more of a maintenance release where the underpinnings have been invested in, some of which mandate pretty material shifts to migrate from Fresh 1 to Fresh 2 without any major new features or capabilities.

## The Bad

Alex Petros of htmx (_providing pretty decent credibility for the topic I'm gonna announce_) gave a talk with perturbing (_for us, frontend engineers_) title of ["What's Left for Frontend Engineers?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7M2inHiT4Y) (_with the accompanying [TL;DR post](https://unplannedobsolescence.com/talks/whats-left-for-frontend-engineers/) for those of us who's into ~~skimming~~ reading_). The web UIs plumbing remnants that he predicts to have keeping us busy in the nearest years are a bit disappointing but on the other hand, these observations confirm my (_obvious for this newsletter_) theory of metaframeworks getting a hold of the web dev of 21st century (_everyone in media has the right for bold prophecies_). So if you're a zealot frontend developer, consider smoothing your "T"-shaped knowledge to "t" or some other (_more ramified_) character.

And while you do that, and getting overwhelmed and panicked of [the amount of choice](https://metaframe.works/comparison/), remember that nobody, even the most clever guys, even the framework creators and maintainers, know everything and can have the clear idea of what to do and how to do it. For instance, the RedwoodSDK guys, [having had split up](<https://metaframe.works/archive/12/#:~:text=The%20RedwoodJS%20team%20had%20come%20with%20a%20huge%20(and%20unexpected)%20split>) with Redwood GraphQL several months ago, try to promote [the repo](https://github.com/redwoodjs/sdk) at all costs (_congrats with the ‚≠ê1k milestone! üéâ_). And one funny way they do it is something new to me ‚Äî [posting the ads](https://github.com/redwoodjs/graphql/releases/tag/announce-redwoodsdk) into/as the release/tag of another repo (_the very [Redwood GraphQL](https://github.com/redwoodjs/graphql)_). Is it weird? Definitely so. Is it worth it? Probably, but arguably. Anyway, now I know a thing more about open-source guerilla, thanks guys!

## The Noteworthy

Astro team, prolific as usual, had released [the new minor 5.13](https://astro.build/blog/astro-5130/) (_they call "Lucky" in the hope to get away from the nemesis of doom_) with some nuggets like multiple sitemaps and enums in Astro DB tables. Honestly, why would anyone use anything else (_for static websites at least_) in 2025?!

BTW, for some shameful reasons Astro is missing in the list of participants of the new beginning from Github (_which is just an identity-less [part of some minor MS department](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/github-will-be-folded-into-microsoft-proper-as-ceo-steps-down/) now I guess, but still_) ‚Äî [GitHub Secure Open Source Fund](https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/securing-the-supply-chain-at-scale-starting-with-71-important-open-source-projects/). This fund includes all the cool guys from the metaframeworks scene now ‚Äî Next, Nuxt, and Svelte, and it sounds like a good addition to all the investment these projects get lately.

All in all, the amount of positivity and inventions of all sorts in the industry is increasing (_coinciding with the amount of OpenAI tokens consumed globally, but... nuh..._) and it gives a hope for better outcomes for all of us, metaframeworks users. Or, in the worst case scenario, will present a couple of satisfied smirks to metaframeworks skeptics. We gonna have fun inevitably anyways, so stay tuned!
