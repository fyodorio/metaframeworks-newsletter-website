[🎶 _Sometimes I see how the brave new world arrives and I see how it thrives in the ashes of our lives..._ 🎶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Uo0JAUWijM&list=PLYRq_7Yox1jDETeL_YgKUc8DXduCV9jA2&index=39)

Yeah, the title of this issue sounds slightly outdated. But FWIW, this is the first issue of 2026 so it is legitimate, and also serves as a kickoff for some thoughts on what's gonna happen in this year both with the metaframeworks industry, and with this project itself. Not gonna turn it into intimidatingly long read though, so let's skip any fuss and get right to the business.

## The Good

## The Bad

## The Noteworthy

...

As we could see, there are positive and negative trends around, as usual. I for that matter hope everyone (and you personally ❤️) will strive to stay on a light side in 2026 and do the best to bring more positivity into the niche. Let's stick with the main discourse of this newsletter, namely — ideating, innovating, building, delivering, repeating all of that, and persevering.
