[🎶 _I find a balance in the middle of the chaos, send me up, send me down, semi never demigod…_ 🎶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60ClcNYWu4&list=PLYRq_7Yox1jDETeL_YgKUc8DXduCV9jA2&index=35)

Zero is selected to be a topic as a metaphor for a pivot in the metaframeworks-related discourse in recent years. From being something hip and slick (_as opposed to conventional backend-driven full-stack solutions_) to getting to be overwhelmingly enterprisey and heavy with further developments. On the other hand, this newsletter holds a sane balance in terms of relation to metaframeworks — neither love nor hate, rather research, with some opinions. Additionally, zero somewhat symbolizes the exhaustion and [fatigue accumulated among developers](https://dev.to/cheetah100/full-stack-fatigue-22de) using modern technologies, including metaframeworks — from the actual technological complexity and cross-stack FOMO to annoying proliferation and pressure of AIs of all sorts. From the noble attempts to decrease the number of degrees of freedom through cutting away junk (_with projects like [e18e](https://e18e.dev)_) to constant stream of vulnerabilities in the unavoidable supply chain.

Last weekend I had a transforming experience of working with Alpine Linux 3.14 on ISH (_an iPad terminal app — don't ask_) — no GUIs, no fancy IDEs (_welcome the trinity of nano, vim, and emacs_), no AI, not even a glimpse of modern Node or TypeScript. I felt enlightened — like a person teleporting to a quiet, deep Canadian forest after walking several miles through Singapore's downtown.

Zero is something we need to gravitate towards to avoid being burnt out. And different people and tools approach that differently. Let's look at these efforts and see for ourselves.

## The Good

Ryan Carniato came up with [the isomorphic-first approach](https://hackmd.io/@0u1u3zEAQAO0iYWVAStEvw/SkM6lc_Cge) and architecture, [answering](https://bsky.app/profile/ryansolid.bsky.social/post/3m4jfqddgfs2e) some important challenges and biases in the full-stack web development industry. For me personally that was such an insightful bird's-eye view on the topic that complements the mental model of the different levels of UI rendering in web applications — and having such a mental model is very important for any professional.

Ryan's point of view is supported by [the research (and discussion)](https://www.developerway.com/posts/react-server-components-performance) from Nadia Makarevich with detailed comparative performance analysis of CSR, SSR, and RSC when used for solving the same problem. While not harshly judging any of the ways, the author objectively (_though tangentially_) confirms Ryan's conclusions that can be summarized with the short and wise "it depends".

All these thoughts and research push readers (_intentionally or not — who knows_) more and more to comparatively new and flexible solutions like TanStack Start — for instance, as Tessa Mero suggests, [as a replacement for ubiquitous Next.js](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/why-developers-leaving-nextjs-tanstack-start). Meanwhile, the metaframework authors themselves [thoughtfully ideate](https://tanstack.com/blog/directives-and-the-platform-boundary) on (_our known and loved_) directives and platform boundaries.

Other frameworks also seek a way to address common industry (_and React's specifically_) problems. Recently reborn Remix does that by diverging from React more and more, [as Brendan McLoughlin noticed](https://laconicwit.com/react-and-remix-choose-different-futures/), while the Svelte team persists with their cybernetical enhancements, releasing another one — [granularly addressing optimistic background performance improvements](https://bsky.app/profile/rich-harris.dev/post/3m423qxk4j227) for web app UI loading.

## The Bad

Npm ecosystem gets hit tough again with [new](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phantomraven-attack-floods-npm-with-credential-stealing-packages/) (_have you ever heard about “slopsquatting” for a change?_) and [new](https://socket.dev/blog/10-npm-typosquatted-packages-deploy-credential-harvester) (_just boring lame typosquatting this time, meh_) vulnerabilities of the same kinds already habitual for developers building webapps compiled to JavaScript. How to protect from all that nightmare we see in dev news each week? Check out the links for specific guidance, or just use Alpine Linux 3.14 on ISH without Internet access, as I do — easy-peasy...

## The Noteworthy

Something I personally am excited about lately in the line of ecosystem updates is [Analog v2.0 release](https://dev.to/analogjs/announcing-analogjs-20-348d). Being an Angular fiend for years, I follow the goodies from Brandon Roberts and the team, and there's a lot to see and explore there — especially for Angular developers, not spoiled with interesting industry innovations. Or with Vite (_which is [the hero of October](https://voidzero.dev/posts/whats-new-oct-2025), to say the least_)...

Nuxt also doesn't calm down on v4 and proceeds enhancing the toolchain [in v4.2](https://nuxt.com/blog/v4-2).

Astro is in the first rows of innovations too, and you can find a lot of specific details of that in [their October's summary](https://astro.build/blog/whats-new-october-2025/), but mainly — their [new minor version 5.15](https://astro.build/blog/astro-5150/) widening even further the already rich ecosystem integrations.

Another update from the JavaScript/TypeScript world I'm really excited (and surprised) about is [Storybook v10](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-10/) (_didn't we update to v9 just days ago?!_) which got lighter, ESM-ier (_the ESM-iest, I'd even say_) and more developer-friendly (_and it is one of my best digital friends in each webdev project already, 100%_).

All in all, this fortnight metaframework restaurant delivery compilation turned out to be quite complex and thought-provoking. But even so, while zeroing in on the latest and greatest, we shouldn't forget to zone out periodically and remember that everything we see on these fancy screens is just zeros and ones, even those wise chatbots making all the boring stuff (_and often fun stuff too, let's face it_) for us. Don't forget to think for yourself, as in our industry there are no right or wrong solutions until they work. So let's proceed making them do it.
