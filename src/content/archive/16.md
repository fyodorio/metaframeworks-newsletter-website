ðŸŽµ _Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you got 'til it's gone? They paved paradise to put up a parking lotâ€¦_ ðŸŽµ

The stuff in the software world changes constantly and we all, working in the industry, may say that people do that with good intentions. But what happens eventually and if the results bring good or bad consequences â€” only time shows that. In this issue of the Metaframeworks Weekly we will try to analize if the ecosystem news we see in tech resources are brought for real developer value or just to make some quick money on the current hype.

## The Good

After [the recent weird divide](<https://metaframe.works/archive/12/#:~:text=The%20RedwoodJS%20team%20had%20come%20with%20a%20huge%20(and%20unexpected)%20split.>) in the Redwood project (_not sure how to call it now â€” RedwoodJS, RedwoodSDK, Redwood GraphQL, or something else, but there should be some kind of forest there anyway for these trees_), the guys started to come up with lots of insights on full-stack web development, tools, and philosophy behind. While all of that might sound a bit chaotic, there's some decent core of wisdom in their recent blogposts (_authored by Herman Stander, though sometimes I felt some strong Hunter S. Thompson ~~presence~~ influence_).

In [the piece on the web evolution](https://rwsdk.com/blog/back-to-the-future), the guys set scene for the current RedwoodSDK project developments making them sound logical prolongation of the history of web software development.

[The next article](https://rwsdk.com/blog/true-js-fullstack) is called "Fullstack in the true sense" hinting to the Redwood's positioning as some kind of reimagined full-stack answer to all the problems of the aforementioned evolution (_with a strong Cloudflare scent_).

And [the most recent blog post](https://rwsdk.com/blog/full-stack-colocation) actually demoes some practices and opinions related to implementing these answers, like so-called full-stack co-location. While not being something new for many web frameworks (_Hi, Angular!_), this approach sounds like some revelation for the neo-React world which probably just an illusion cased by the author's message tone, but still. Everything old is new again.

Anyway, even if you won't learn a lot [new] from this Redwood's thought leadership marathon, it still is a good direction and brilliant format for creating a good wider developer tribe around the [pretty narrow] technology, so kudos to the team.

## The Bad

Another interesting opinion about the good and (_rather_) the bad parts of Next.js came from the guys at Hardcover (_who do something around books in 2025 so there's no reason not to trust them_). [The article](https://hardcover.app/blog/part-1-how-we-fell-out-of-love-with-next-js-and-back-in-love-with-ruby-on-rails-inertia-js) called "How We Fell Out of Love with Next.js and Back in Love with Ruby on Rails & Inertia.js" starts some kind of series dedicated to the topic and tangentially related to the web evolutions described in one of the Redwood's articles mentioned before but in slightly backward direction. There's a lot to digest and multiple edge-casy prerequisites, but all in all, among the sane opinions and pains, one can find a good bunch of advice on assessing one's tech stack in a thoughtful and reasonable way, even if you are not going to give up on Next.js and metaframeworks as a whole.

## The Noteworthy

The last week brought some notable new releases and events worth mentioning, as usual, and the ground of it all is of course [the release of Node v24 with npm v11](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v24.0.0). Time to update your `.nvmrc` and some GitHub actions, isn't it?

But even if it's not, and you're too busy with your agentic AI project, there's something interesting for you too. Not only Redwood went full on Cloudflare way, but there's also some efforts from the Nuxt team around that, specifically [the NuxtHub](https://hub.nuxt.com). They have released [hubAutoRag](https://hub.nuxt.com/changelog/hub-autorag) for creating fully-managed RAG pipelines potentially allowing the religious Nuxt fans to stop using Vercel's AI SDK for that purpose. Need to accept, Nuxt guys are doing great team around the projects from different sides of the stack, and TIL, there's even [the Raycast extension](https://www.raycast.com/HugoRCD/nuxt) for auxiliary Nuxt tasks.

There were not too much other metaframeworks-related releases recently, but the React Router [got its new minor](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v760) which always means some goodies for traditional React (_and Remix now!_) development teams these days. Moreover, the guys did some decent [bugsquashing](https://x.com/BrooksLybrand/status/1918406062920589731) with lots of resulting important fixes making the tooling even more stable and trustable.

Last but not least, Barcelona seem to had a flood of Svelte developers the last week, hosting the [Svelte Summit](https://www.sveltesummit.com). There were lots of [insightful talks](https://www.sveltesummit.com/#talks), as usual, both from the core team members and the ecosystem representatives, so if you're biting your elbows for not visiting it, you can still [watch the recording](https://www.sveltesummit.com/#talks) just for [fourty bucks](https://www.sveltesummit.com/virtual-ticket) (_instead of a couple of months wasted on trying to make Cursor subscription work, for instance_).
