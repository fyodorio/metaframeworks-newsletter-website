[ðŸŽ¶ _I'm not trying to cause a big sensation, I'm just talkin' 'bout my generation..._ ðŸŽ¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjN5uHRIcjM&list=PLYRq_7Yox1jDETeL_YgKUc8DXduCV9jA2&index=34)

The last fortnight brought a lot of mind-boggling updates of all sorts. Starting with framework-level philosophical doctrines and up to Oscar-worth performances from JS bundler developers, with some habitual controversies, and many highly-anticipated releases. Metaframework developers give abundant food for thoughts almost daily so let's enjoy the spicy snack. Bon appetit!

## The Good

October is a conference season, especially in JS world, and in-person communication brings a lot of inspiration to event participants, along with the true sense of community. This is the time when initiatives like [Svelte tenets](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/discussions/10085) surface up and find the genuine support, especially on the background of [the recent dubious events](https://metaframe.works/archive/32/#:~:text=everything%20around%20Vercel%20became%20doomed%20for%20some%20of%20us).

> As a community our default position is one of optimism about technology â€” the platform is getting better, our tools are getting better, our devices are getting better, and if we embrace that fact we can make better stuff.

And one of the main heroes of the ecosystem enbetterment is Vite. The recent (_first in-person!_) [ViteConf](https://viteconf.amsterdam) brought up a [whole bunch of goodies](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGQbXn_GDmkJaoykvHCUmXUPjhgH2bVr) from the team of maintainers and the community, with the most heart-warming one being [the new Vite documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWQqAKLgT4).

> If you're using a JavaScript framework, you're probably using Vite.

Evan You [had announced](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-vite-plus) the early access for [Vite+](https://viteplus.dev), the unified toolchain for web developers, explaining the way VoidZero team is going to monetize all the titanic and Rust-heavy surrounding efforts. It would be fair to assume the guys were inspired by [UmiJS ecosystem](https://metaframe.works/archive/11/#:~:text=Chinese%20enterprise%20developers%20have%20access%20to%20a%20decently%20innovative%20set%20of%20tools%20and%20technologies%20for%20building%20web%20applications%20and%20web%20sites).

Another important announcement was [the JavaScript plugins support in Oxlint](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-oxlint-js-plugins), the blazingly-fast ESLint killer. As the new plugins API is compatible with ESLint's plugins, migrating to Oxlint may become a no-brainer for people who don't like linter-run-waiting-driven coffee breaks.

Vitest also had gotten its own star moment with [version 4 announcement](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-vitest-4) bringing improvements that may make you think about getting rid of most of your other testing-related dependencies (_with browser mode, visual regression testing, and Playwright traces for better test debugging_).

But not only VoidZero had something to brag about. Vercel [announced beta for Next 16](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16-beta) (_I have just started to get used to the number 15!_), and [published the main release](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16) almost right after that. The guys have a good answer to Vite â€” Turbopack, which is now declared to be stable, alongside with support for the latest and greatest from React world (_including compiler_) and improvements to partial prerendering. Also [the new proxi file](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/proxy) replaces a middleware file, probably in a hope adversaries won't spot [middleware vulnerabilities](https://metaframe.works/archive/11/#:~:text=huge%20scandal%20around%20the%20middleware%20security%20vulnerability%20in%20Next.js) anymore, heh.

The last of the comparatively _huge_ controversial news from the latest weeks was [introduction of Remix 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZl0IKj0HHc), or rather some new details on what it's gonna be, which draw a lot of attention from the metaframeworks-savvy community and React fans (_and haters alike_) â€” though as it happens, there's neither React nor even Preact in this whole story. The whole idea would be much more obscure if not the cool guy Mark Dalgleish and his [Remix 3 Resources repo](https://github.com/markdalgleish/remix3-resources), where you can find both the theoretical details, and practical examples of Remix 3 usage. You can even use it [with Storybook](https://github.com/markdalgleish/remix-storybook-example) already, which is quite exciting for those who like a good story.

## The Bad

And while new metaframeworks come, some old friends do go away. One of the pioneers of metaframework+ (_a metaframework with ~~blackjack and hookers~~ more bells and whistles_) movement, RedwoodJS, has got [its last update](https://github.com/redwoodjs/graphql/releases/tag/v8.9.0) and was announced to not be maintained anymore, in favour of [RedwoodSDK](https://rwsdk.com). You can also use the less known fork of it â€” [CedarJS](https://cedarjs.com) (_or use other full-blown alternatives like [Wasp](https://wasp.sh), or [Blitz.js](https://blitzjs.com)_) but this nostalgic feeling of a Thomas Preston-Werner epoch fading away is inevitable.

Among other bad news of the latest weeks was the security breach [found in Better-auth](https://zeropath.com/blog/breaking-authentication-unauthenticated-api-key-creation-in-better-auth-cve-2025-61928) â€” one of the most popular framework-agnostic authentication tools used in the JS ecosystem. With authentication being the least acceptable part of your app to give up to adversaries, this account-takeover breach brings doubts in ubiquitous mantra of "always use existing solutions for everything".

But maybe it's just the matter of good security solutions we developers should be aware of. And while I'm not a big fan of SDK-driven approaches in this regard, the tools like Arcjet, who [provides support for Nuxt and React Router now](https://blog.arcjet.com/secure-nuxt-and-react-router-applications-at-scale-with-arcjets-new-sdks/), might be a minimal step towards avoiding the threats we all already stopped to ignore, [especially lately](https://metaframe.works/archive/31/#:~:text=There%20were%20several%20attacks%20on%20the%20npm%20ecosystem).

## The Noteworthy

While Vite is taking the industry by storm on more and more levels starting historically from top (_front end_), Bun goes up and up from their low-level runtime ground widening the range of tools they provide. [Version 1.3 brings a lot of decent updates](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3) including full-stack dev server, more support for SQL DBs, integrated Redis client, and traditional (_and important_) Node compatibility improvements. And even though [some people doubt](https://dev.to/wojtekmaj/why-using-bun-in-production-maybe-isnt-the-best-idea-3deb) the project is ready yet, who knows, maybe someday we won't need [meta]frameworks at all, just open Bun and start the full-stack webapp ride...

But until we're not there, I'm still excited about (_even the early_) releases of tools like Nitro, whose version 3 is [coming closer](https://github.com/nitrojs/nitro/releases/tag/v3.0.1-alpha.0) with lots of [long-waited updates](https://masteringnuxt.com/blog/nitro-v3-whats-coming-with-nuxt-5) that more and more metaframeworks share these days.

Another important pre-release of the recent times in the JS ecosystem was [the beta of Preact 11](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/releases/tag/11.0.0-beta.0) with which the guys are going to refresh the framework avoiding drastic breaking changes as much as possible at the same time.

Something that brings some hope for developing original innovations in the industry is the return of Aral Roca with [version 0.2.15](https://github.com/brisa-build/brisa/releases/tag/0.2.15) of his Bun-bound Brisa metaframework.

And last but not least â€” important middleware improvements in [version 4.10.0 of Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono/releases/tag/v4.10.0).

Lot of stuff changes constantly in the metaframeworks world, but one thing remains â€” the permanent striving for innovation in a diverse way, which is the most important thing, as this is the only path to this technology becoming a boring technology eventually â€” in a good meaning of this term. Meanwhile, I'm happy my generation of metaframeworks developer don't sit idle but searches for new awesome ways to create full-stack web applications faster and better. Here's to more [records](https://metaframe.works/archive/) on this journey!
