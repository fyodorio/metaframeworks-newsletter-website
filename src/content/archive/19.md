ðŸŽ¶ _My cock is much bigger than yours..._ ðŸŽ¶

Today we talk about multiple developer boys and toys, their never ending arms race, and the role of a marketing message in a project place in the ecosystem which shouldn't be too prone to following the messages religiously. This trend is not always bad, or adversary, or toxic, or whatnot in any negative way. It just recognizably annoys the pleasure of tool using out of the developer experience sometimes, as a side effect of the overall innovation excitement. It's understandable, as many teams are trying to get up to speed with the AI race and bring as much novelty and curiosity to stay in the first cars of the hype train. The eyes in this regard are mostly staring at Remix and Redwood, of course, but also at some groundbreaking technologies like the Vite ecosystem, of course. And we're starting with the latter as (arguably) the most anticipated and (undoubtedly) useful.
