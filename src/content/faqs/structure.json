  "answer": "Yes, the idea is to address a passed week of metaframeworks ecosystem life from the side of *Good* news, like new shiny releases, or awesome performant features and innovations, *Bad* news, which not always bad per se but might bring some thoughts about the obscure ways of metaframeworks and metaframework-based software or tooling around, and *Noteworthy* news and topics, which may or may not be huge or related to metaframeworks directly but obviously have something to do with the ecosystem. I have found that there's always something to say along these three lines of newsletter storytelling. Though I break the rules [from time to time](/archive/2).",
