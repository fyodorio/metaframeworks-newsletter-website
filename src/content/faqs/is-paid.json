  "question": "Is the newsletter paid, and if no â€” how is it monetized? Who pays for the party?",
  "answer": "The newsletter is free, and I can confirm it will always be this way. That was one of the reasons of making it as minimalist and platform-agnostic as possible. I do not monetize anything here, as I don't like the way others do it. Luckily, I can afford making this enticing journey sustainable without sponsors for now. It also drastically helps to provide independent view on all the topics and tools and avoid bias. That said, if you (dis)like something in the way I emit the project message here, please [let me know](mailto:fyodor@metaframe.works), would be happy to hear any direct feedback.",
