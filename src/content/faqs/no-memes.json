  "question": "Why there are no memes, or cat photos, or other pictures in the newsletter issues?",
  "answer": "I'm a big fan of textual content personally and I truly believe there's no reason to put meaningless images everywhere just for the heck of it. It feels like making a selfie with some fountain or vase just because everyone else does. I love to put dad's jokes here and there though (as I'm a vivid dad ftw). And if I feel some day that there's a good place for a fancy chart or [a rare photo of Rich Harris](https://github.com/fyodorio/awesome-metaframeworks?tab=readme-ov-file#metaframework-heroes), or my own doodle â€” I'll definitely go for it. Otherwise, expect a lot of boring text with pinches of dumb humour and life anecdotes.",
