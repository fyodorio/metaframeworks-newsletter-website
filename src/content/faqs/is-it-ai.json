As I mention in the [About](/about) section though, I'm not a native English speaker (go try to stop my writing through that! \uD83D\uDE05) so I use AI for grammatical error corrections, punctuation consistency, and some stupidity control. But not more. The ideas and texts are mine, no matter how AI-level-dumb they sound sometimes.",
